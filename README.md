# SeAMK-IoTTi-PusherConveyor

## What is what

- ConveyorBeltBase is the base TwinCAT project with only the variables used by the simulation.

- ConveyorBeltComplete is the complete TwinCAT project (used in testing the simulation)

- PusherConveyor.7z contains the Unity project (Unity LTS version 2017.4.15 was used last time)

- Build.7z contains the old simulation that uses the old variables

- Build2.7z contains the newest simulation that uses the variables according to the standard. Inputs were also added for the conveyors. Both TwinCAT projects were updated to match these.

- LiftingPusherConveyor_PLC.vcmx contains the model used (Visual Components project file)

- VM_TwinCAT_isolated_core.docx - Guide to setting isolated core in TwinCAT project (written in finnish)
